I learnt the comprehensive guide to building a semantic search system using LLMs, covering the various components, techniques, and implementation details involved in the process.

1. #### Semantic Search with LLMs
   - Explains the concept of semantic search and how it differs from traditional keyword-based search
   - Introduces text embeddings and their role in capturing semantic meaning
   - Discusses the advantages of using LLMs for generating text embeddings

2. #### The Task
   - Outlines the problem of information retrieval and the limitations of traditional search engines
   - Highlights the need for understanding context and meaning to provide relevant results

3. #### Asymmetric Semantic Search
   - Explains the concept of asymmetric semantic search, which accounts for the imbalance in size and semantic information between the query and documents
   - Highlights the ability of LLMs to understand nuanced queries and match them with relevant documents

4. #### Solution Overview
   - Provides a two-part solution overview:
     1. Ingesting documents: collecting documents, creating text embeddings, and storing them in a database
     2. Retrieving documents: processing user queries, retrieving candidate documents, re-ranking (optional), and returning final search results

5. #### The Components
   - Text Embedder: Explains the role of text embedders in converting text into vector representations
   - Similarity Metrics: Discusses methods for measuring similarity between text embeddings, such as cosine similarity and dot product
   - OpenAI's Embedding: Provides code examples for obtaining text embeddings using OpenAI's API
   - Document Chunking: Introduces the concept of document chunking for embedding large documents, including non-overlapping and overlapping approaches
   - Vector Databases: Explains the need for vector databases and provides examples of open-source and managed solutions
   - Re-ranking Retrieval Results (Optional): Discusses methods for re-ranking search results, such as cross-encoders and traditional retrieval models like BM25

6. #### API
   - Introduces the concept of APIs and their role in connecting software components
   - Highlights the use of FastAPI for building a semantic search API

7. #### Putting It All Together
   - Summarizes the complete solution by listing the components involved in ingesting and retrieving documents

8. #### Building a Q/A Bot with ChatGPT
   - Outlines the steps for building a question-answering bot using ChatGPT and the semantic retrieval system
   - Includes code examples for designing a system prompt, searching for context, injecting context into the prompt, and allowing ChatGPT to generate an answer
